PlyDraw2
========

PlyDraw is a game similar to Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, but with drawing. The server randomly assigns a topic and a judge. The other, non-judge players draw the topic. After the drawings have been sumbmitted, the judge picks his/her favorite, and the artist of it becomes the next judge.
